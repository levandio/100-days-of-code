# 100 Days Of Code - Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on **September 14th, 2020**.

### Day 1: September 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed some recent Python code I wrote as practice in  [@henriquebastos](https://twitter.com/henriquebastos) courses.

**Thoughts**: I pushed the actual coding for later in the day and I regret that decision dearly. Although I had some idea of what I was doing, very little code was done because my brain was shutting down. I spent most of my time getting acquainted with Python again, so not all hope is lost.

### Day 2: September 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More review and a bit of refactoring.

**Thoughts**: Started coding earlier in the day but still struggled to clock 1 hour in. The routine is definitely the worst part... :/

### Day 3: September 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my website [livialima.net](livialima.net) today. Some HTML/CSS house-cleaning.

**Thoughts**: Today I had to shift my focus a little bit back to my website since other projects are still ongoing. Just a bit of house-cleaning the HTML and CSS code but nothing really new. Found out about [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) which is a [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) on steroids. Needless to say that I started to use it immediately.
