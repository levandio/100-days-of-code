# 100 Days Of Code - Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on **September 14th, 2020**.

### Day 1: September 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed some recent Python code I wrote as practice in  [@henriquebastos](https://twitter.com/henriquebastos) courses.

**Thoughts**: I pushed the actual coding for later in the day and I regret that decision dearly. Although I had some idea of what I was doing, very little code was done because my brain was shutting down. I spent most of my time getting acquainted with Python again, so not all hope is lost.

### Day 2: September 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More review and a bit of refactoring.

**Thoughts**: Started coding earlier in the day but still struggled to clock 1 hour in. The routine is definitely the worst part... :/

---------------------------------------------
### Day 3: September 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my website [livialima.net](livialima.net) today. Some HTML/CSS house-cleaning.

**Thoughts**: Today I had to shift my focus a little bit back to my website since other projects are still ongoing. Just a bit of house-cleaning the HTML and CSS code but nothing really new. Found out about [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) which is a [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) on steroids. Needless to say that I started to use it immediately.

### Day 4: September 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Very busy day, I barely had time to code. But I did, so... yay?

**Thoughts**: Short and sweet session, worked a bit with file handling in Python.

### Day 5: September 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tired. One bad day is ok. I'll get back tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: ![No projects today...](https://media.giphy.com/media/llZ2R6hwJVxWE/giphy.gif "No projects today...")

---------------------------------------------
### Day 6: September 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Slowly getting back on track. Learned to handle files in Python, got an idea for a project.

**Thoughts**: I received some motivation from the community of [#100DaysofCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hashtag_click) and got back on the code train with renewed energy. Didn't do much but learned more about files in Python. I had an idea for a project that apply those principles. I basically want to lint the closed captions for my videos. Let's see if I can pull this off.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 7: September 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I had several uninterrupted hours to mess with dictionaries, lists and tuples on Python. Sundays, amiright?

**Thoughts**: Lots of refactoring and learning (re-learning?) data structures was fun! Finally feeling the code juices flowing.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 8: September 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: The progress I've made yesterday motivated me to practice the basics with more variety. I referred back to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) for Python specific challenges.

**Thoughts**: The few hours of deep work yesterday were eye-opening and moved me towards different challenges to practice (and solidify) those newly learned topics. I was a casual user of CodeWars, [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [exercism](https://exercism.io/) and [Leet](https://leetcode.com/). Now I have a goal with those tools.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 9: September 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More Python at [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), not much time to spare.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 10: September 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit more on the project I was dealing with this week. The time with [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) was productive.

**Thoughts**: Practicing was a good idea to get my eyes refocused on the project with some new perspective. Since I coded unrelated solutions, it was interesting seeing them fall into place when I got back to the project.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 11: September 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Bad day, personal issues. Got some code done (and that gave me a spark of joy). Persistence is key.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 12: September 25, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Had to work on other stuff today, so no code. Back at it tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Apparently I am bad at Fridays...

---------------------------------------------
### Day 13: September 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Tomorrow is a big day, so code today was light. Some [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) challenges to keep the brain working.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 14: September 27, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Accomplishments today were on the infra/network side of things, so code was a bit sidelined. I tested [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/) though. Interesting use of gamification to learn programming.

![CodinGame](https://static.codingame.com/assets/video_poster_02.da066dd1.jpg "CodinGame")

**Thoughts**: Today I passed my [Juniper JNCIA-Junos](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/36fd8200-df7f-4768-adac-c0d1fef987e6/public_url) exam! I was nervous the last few days because I was doubting myself (a thing I should stop doing immediately). But, success! Let's just say that I can see all this Python thing being handy with this new acquired skil.

### Day 15: September 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: These 2 weeks have been a rollercoaster! So much that I decided to make a retrospective. to seem what rocked and what flopped.

![Rollercoaster](https://media.giphy.com/media/I6nxG7f3h7qww/giphy.gif "Rollercoaster")

**Thoughts**: When I made my pledge 15 days ago, I expected to learn to code. I did not expected to learn that much about myself.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 16: September 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Coded earlier today and started to set language goals with Python to implement some structure in this challenge for me. My retrospective had to teach me something, right?

---------------------------------------------
### Day 17: September 30, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Explored more of conditionals and operators in Python.

**Thoughts**: Decided to use [exercism](https://exercism.io) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) as well, as they are a bit more structured than CodeWars for beginners.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 18: October 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Squeezed a few minutes of Python amidst many hours of blog updates (new video coming soon, by the way). Good day.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 19: October 2, Friday - Day 25: October 8, Thursday

**Week's Progress**: New video took longer than expected and I had A LOT of interruptions this week. Not even sure I could count any of that time as part of the challenge progress. Should I start over?
