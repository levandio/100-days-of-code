# 100 Days Of Code - Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on **December 16th, 2020**.

### Day 0: December 16, 2020

**New Start!** I decided to start over after [45-something](R1_log_1st-try.md) days of coding. Too many interruptions and distractions motivated me to start fresh. Let's see how this goes.

Since I failed my last attempt for trying to do too much too soon, I'm taking easy and I'll publish an update only when I feel something interesting has been accomplished. No more daily updates, sorry.
