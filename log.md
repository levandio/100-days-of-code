# 100 Days Of Code - Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on **September 14th, 2020**.

### Day 1: September 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed some recent Python code I wrote as practice in  [@henriquebastos](https://twitter.com/henriquebastos) courses.

**Thoughts**: I pushed the actual coding for later in the day and I regret that decision dearly. Although I had some idea of what I was doing, very little code was done because my brain was shutting down. I spent most of my time getting acquainted with Python again, so not all hope is lost.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 2: September 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More review and a bit of refactoring.

**Thoughts**: Started coding earlier in the day but still struggled to clock 1 hour in. The routine is definitely the worst part... :/

---------------------------------------------
### Day 3: September 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my website [livialima.net](livialima.net) today. Some HTML/CSS house-cleaning.

**Thoughts**: Today I had to shift my focus a little bit back to my website since other projects are still ongoing. Just a bit of house-cleaning the HTML and CSS code but nothing really new. Found out about [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) which is a [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) on steroids. Needless to say that I started to use it immediately.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 4: September 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Very busy day, I barely had time to code. But I did, so... yay?

**Thoughts**: Short and sweet session, worked a bit with file handling in Python.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 5: September 18, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Tired. One bad day is ok. I'll get back tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: ![No projects today...](https://media.giphy.com/media/llZ2R6hwJVxWE/giphy.gif "No projects today...")

**Link to tweet:** [@livialimatweets Day 5](https://twitter.com/livialimatweets/status/1307140527662526467?s=20)

---------------------------------------------
### Day 6: September 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Slowly getting back on track. Learned to handle files in Python, got an idea for a project.

**Thoughts**: I received some motivation from the community of [#100DaysofCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode?src=hashtag_click) and got back on the code train with renewed energy. Didn't do much but learned more about files in Python. I had an idea for a project that apply those principles. I basically want to lint the closed captions for my videos. Let's see if I can pull this off.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 7: September 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I had several uninterrupted hours to mess with dictionaries, lists and tuples on Python. Sundays, amiright?

**Thoughts**: Lots of refactoring and learning (re-learning?) data structures was fun! Finally feeling the code juices flowing.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 8: September 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: The progress I've made yesterday motivated me to practice the basics with more variety. I referred back to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) for Python specific challenges.

**Thoughts**: The few hours of deep work yesterday were eye-opening and moved me towards different challenges to practice (and solidify) those newly learned topics. I was a casual user of CodeWars, [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [exercism](https://exercism.io/) and [Leet](https://leetcode.com/). Now I have a goal with those tools.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 9: September 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More Python at [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/), not much time to spare.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 10: September 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked a bit more on the project I was dealing with this week. The time with [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) was productive.

**Thoughts**: Practicing was a good idea to get my eyes refocused on the project with some new perspective. Since I coded unrelated solutions, it was interesting seeing them fall into place when I got back to the project.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 11: September 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Bad day, personal issues. Got some code done (and that gave me a spark of joy). Persistence is key.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 12: September 25, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Had to work on other stuff today, so no code. Back at it tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Apparently I am bad at Fridays...

---------------------------------------------
### Day 13: September 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Tomorrow is a big day, so code today was light. Some [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) challenges to keep the brain working.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 14: September 27, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Accomplishments today were on the infra/network side of things, so code was a bit sidelined. I tested [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/) though. Interesting use of gamification to learn programming.

![CodinGame](https://static.codingame.com/assets/video_poster_02.da066dd1.jpg "CodinGame")

**Thoughts**: Today I passed my [Juniper JNCIA-Junos](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/36fd8200-df7f-4768-adac-c0d1fef987e6/public_url) exam! I was nervous the last few days because I was doubting myself (a thing I should stop doing immediately). But, success! Let's just say that I can see all this Python thing being handy with this new acquired skil.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 15: September 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: These 2 weeks have been a rollercoaster! So much that I decided to make a retrospective. to seem what rocked and what flopped.

![Rollercoaster](https://media.giphy.com/media/I6nxG7f3h7qww/giphy.gif "Rollercoaster")

**Thoughts**: When I made my pledge 15 days ago, I expected to learn to code. I did not expected to learn that much about myself.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 16: September 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Coded earlier today and started to set language goals with Python to implement some structure in this challenge for me. My retrospective had to teach me something, right?

---------------------------------------------
### Day 17: September 30, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Explored more of conditionals and operators in Python.

**Thoughts**: Decided to use [exercism](https://exercism.io) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) as well, as they are a bit more structured than CodeWars for beginners.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 18: October 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Squeezed a few minutes of Python amidst many hours of blog updates (new video coming soon, by the way). Good day.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 19: October 2, Friday - October 8, Thursday (I guess...?)

**Week's Progress**: New video took longer than expected and I had A LOT of interruptions this week. Not even sure I could count any of that time as part of the challenge progress. Should I start over?

---------------------------------------------
### Day 20: October 9, Friday (for reals this time)

**Today's Progress**: [New video](https://livialima.net/howtos/howto-connect-2pcs-crossover-cable.html) is out, I did a bunch of MD/HTML/CSS tweaks on my website and started coding the automation for that build. Still wrapping my head around how to do it with Lambda.

**Thoughts**: Obviously I'm taking way too much manual labor every time I want to post new content. I'm pulling on the breaks a little bit to automate that build & publish process; in addition to all the content work, I was considering quitting the 100Days challenge. Thanks to the #100DaysOfCode community for keeping my spirits up!

---------------------------------------------
### Day 21: October 10, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Yay! Today I did my first [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function to update a [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) table! It's not working as expected (yet) but I'm getting close.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 22: October 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: More experiments with AWS, tested more Python code to basic-handle DynamoDB tables, outside of Lambda so I could really understand it. Got my ass kicked by JSON, obviously. Also looked at [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), but just looked.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 23: October 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I more than "looked" at API Gateway. This is starting to get very interesting!

**Thoughts**: I got my ass kicked by the API calls and had to spend about 30 minutes doing tests with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to figure out what was the best for my project.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 24: October 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Too much going on today. No actual coding, but learned a lot about coding. Nice!

**Thoughts**: Today I was attending the [AnsibleFest](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp) so I got little time for coding. Ansible is in my wishlist of things to learn in my journey of network automation.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 25: October 14, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I wrote Python code in a Lambda function and used the [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) library to handle a DynamoDB table. Then I created an API with AWS’s API Gateway to accept requests from the web to update that table. It was now JavaScript's turn to kick my ass.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 26: October 15, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: That little piece of JavaScript (the only JS needed for this project) is continuously kicking me in the face. Undefined data is the best I got so far. I found out API Gateway can generate a JS SDK but I have no idea how to use it yet. Help.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 27: October 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: It turns out I didn't have to use the JS SDK, just integrate the API with the Lambda function with a proper proxy. I could finally fetch the data the way I wanted and the JavaScript code is working! YAY!

**Thoughts**: It took me 3 days to understand the problem was not the JavaScript call to the API. It was the response I had setup when I created the API. Which means this piece of code is perfectly fine:
```
function incrementCount() {
	var d1 = document.getElementById('visits');
	const visits = fetch('https://api.livialima.net/')
		.then(res => res.json())
		.then(data => d1.insertAdjacentText('beforeend', data))
		.catch(error => console.log(error))
}
```

---------------------------------------------
### Day 28: October 17, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I spent a lot of the last few days on AWS Console. I was wondering if I could do it in AWS CLI. Better, is there a way to automate this process? Today was a study day, learning more about AWS services.

**Link to tweet:** [@livialimatweets Day 28](https://twitter.com/livialimatweets/status/1317625638455566336?s=20)

---------------------------------------------
### Day 29: October 18, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learning about AWS SAM. I'm still pretty clueless. YAML seems a little more friendly, though.

**Thoughts**: Learning means I had to install SAM CLI and dust off AWS CLI a bit. I took my time and looked at [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) to understand how that works.

**Link to tweet:** [@livialimatweets Day 29](https://twitter.com/livialimatweets/status/1317978078442762240?s=20)

---------------------------------------------
### Day 30: October 19, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still trying to finish the project with a bang of Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Tomorrow I will publish my second retrospective, reviewing days 16 to 30.

**Thoughts**: Spend time toying with CloudFormation and writing some test stacks in YAML. I want to be familiar with it before diving into SAM templates.

---------------------------------------------
### Day 31: October 20, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: The first part of the whole "automate the build & publish process" for my website was to finish the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev) by [Forrest Brazeal](https://forrestbrazeal.com/) - which is almost complete. In this retrospective, I review what I learned since Day15 and what I'm planning for the next few days.
